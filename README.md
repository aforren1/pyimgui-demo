Install pyimgui with `pip install imgui==1.0.0a2` (repo is https://github.com/swistakm/pyimgui).

Run the example with `python test_imgui.py`.

I made some tweaks to ShapeStim to make it play well simultaneously with the imgui window, but couldn't figure out some of the other *Stims (e.g. RadialStim). You can install the tweaks at `pip install git+https://github.com/aforren1/psychopy@pyimgui-tweaks`, which is fairly up-to-date (Feb 7th).
